# 📄 Form-Cert-PDF

A simple and customizable form tool that allows users to input client and product details to generate a professional **warranty certificate**. Once filled, users can download the certificate as a **PDF** with a single click.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project was built to streamline the creation of warranty certificates. Instead of editing templates manually, just fill out a form with all the needed details — including client information and products — and click "Generate" to create a certificate. Then download it directly as a PDF.

> 🧾 **Note:** This tool is intentionally **manual-input only**, based on the client's specific request. All fields (client data and product entries) are to be typed manually — no automation or database connection is used.
